# hello-world
My first experience with github 
This is my first job as a Technical project manager.  I'm learning Github to be more effective with the team.
So far the instructions for "hello-world" have been easy to follow.

Who knows, maybe before long I'll be writing my own code!

what do you get when too many PMs try and design a horse?
A camel.
